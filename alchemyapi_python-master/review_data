           'text': u"\n Got this phone on the Next day I ordered. Thanks to Flipkart First Subscription!  \nI will refrain myself from writing long stories and telling the things you can simply see in the product description. I will simply write down my thoughts on the parameters which matters most. Lets come to Phone now:  \n1. Build Quality: 4.5/5 Back panel is scratch proof with matte finish. Cutting 0.5 star because chrome is of Plastic, not metallic.\n2. 2 GB of High Frequency RAM and awesome RAM management: 5/5\n3. Perfect Screen size. Larger screen could have decreased battery backup. 5/5\n4. Resolution is perfect for the price range and PPI makes it much better. 5/5\n5. Battery life is too good. Even though it is having only 2470 mAH battery, with 100% charge, I downloaded about 40 apps on 4G, used whatsapp, gaming of 1 Hour, used calling, SMS and other common features throughout the day (12 hours) and the battery was still 5%: 5/5\n6. Camera quality is good (not awesome) in indoors and AWESOME in outdoors with sunlight. They gave Slow motion video feature as in Iphone that is more than awesomeeeeee: 4/5\n7. Headphones given are of above average quality but at least they are giving it other wise Zenphone 2 and Honor 4x don't have headphones. 3/5\n8. The phone comes up with dual speakers BUT only one speaker is functional at a time. The phone do not have convertible speakers like we have in Moto nexus 6. Top speaker is just for headset mode and bottom speaker is for playing Media. But still, the sound quality is good & loud (very loud). It should have provided two normal speakers for media instead of one loud speaker because multiple speakers creates surround sound. 4/5\n9. Water resistant phone, I splashed a glass of water but It is working..!!!! Just remember to close the back lid as mentioned in the sticker. \n10. Original Flip Cover AVAILABLE!!! You cannot use duplicate flip cover (one that replaces original back lid) because your phone will no longer be water proof.\n11. You can connect 2 USB cables with charging adapter. It means you can charge two phones simultaneously. THATS AMAZING!!!! However, the adapter is of 1150 mAh, means it will take atleast 2.5 hours for full charge. 4/5 \n12. Just like apple, motorola has learnt how to provide flawless performance with low-medium specs (Just like iphone's top model has 1GB RAM only). The phone do not have super high speed processor, but the processing management is so awesome that there are NO LAGS even with using multiple applications simultaneously. 5/5\n13. Good screen to body ratio with minimum wastage. Like HTC phones waste too much space below and above the screen and make phones unnecessarily larger. This phone utilizes the maximum area and keeps phone pocket sized.  \nNOTE: The phone comes with free airtel 4G SIM but there are no instructions on flipkart on how to use it. Don't worry, you don't have to rush to Airtel Store to use it. Simply type: SIM SPACE NEW_SIM_NUMBER from your airtel mobile number and send it to 121. The new SIM will be activated within 10 minutes. However, some of my friends got expired SIM. In such case, it shows that SIM number is incorrect. You can get SIM number from back side of the sim. I inserted Airtel 4G SIM in slot 1 of this phone and got AMAZING speed of 28 Mbps :D  \nALSO I bought original MOTO Flip cover worth Rs. 1799 with this phone and got Rs. 549 OFF. :D To verify if the offer still exist, Add this phone and original Moto Flip Cover to your cart. If your luck is good, you'll see Rs. 549 off there.  \nWARNING: DO NOT PLAY WITH WATER RESISTANCE FEATURE. IT IS JUST TO KEEP YOUR PHONE SAFE IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS. PROLONGED IMMERSION IN WATER OR USAGE OF SPEAKERS WHILE DIPPED IN WATER MAY CAUSE DAMAGE.  \nOverall, I would rate it 4.5/5 stars. Its a great deal for this price range. If your budget is 13K, just order this phone without thinking much. Hit like button if you found my review useful ;)   ",

           'text': u"\n I have been using this phone for more than a MONTH now and i would like to say that i am quite satisfied with the product as of now.Let me break it down in terms of pros and cons for you guys- \nPros- \n1. Design:- The phone is classy and looks quite stylish in looking and gives a very good in hand feel when you're using it. \n2. Camera:- The camera on this moto g3 is great.I mean one can capture really good photos with it, be it front or back.This is the case when you are in good or medium lightning conditions,so if you're clicking pictures in dark or low lighting the picture quality is only mediocre(Rear&Front) and looks a little bit artificial(Front Cam).But i suppose that's the case with every other smartphone in this price range. \n3.Battery:-Battery is a major concern now -a-days and also the previous model of this phone i.e the moto g2 had battery issues.But this phone can give you a really good battery backup.It can easily last you a day even with heavy usage if you give it a full charge in the morning.It takes 2:45 minutes to charge from 0 to 100 with first 85% charged in just 2 hours.I am getting approx 5 hours of screen on time(2 sims,1 sim being 3g and the other 2g with mobile data on) and approx 7.5 hours of screen on time if the mobile data is off.So i think it's great.Isn't it? \n4.Performance:- Performance is absolutely smooth.No hanging issues.Working without flaws(Asphalt 8, fifa15,dead trigger 2,Leo's fortune and many more games resides on my storage ^_^ ).Handling all without any problems \n5.RAM:- As you know you're getting 2 Gigabytes of RAM on this device and i must say ram is way more than enough for a user.I have around 82 apps installed on this phone including the built-in-apps and still there is 700-800 mb free space in RAM all the time.So it's fckin' cool guys! :) \n6.Storage:- You're getting around 11 Gb free for user out of 16 gb internal storage.Besides that,one can expand it through sd card for upto 32 Gb! \nCons- \n1. Display- The first & d formost con that i noticed in this device was the display.It really annoyed me at first coz sometimes white looks a lil bit yellowish and color production isn't accurate as it should be.So if you're not so concerned about colors,just ignore it.You myt also not notice it in the day to day usage.So not a big issue,atleast for me! \n2. Heating issues:- Wasn't really an issue if you have asked me about the phone a week ago.Don't get me wrong,in normal usage you won't feel any heating problem on this device but when i play asphalt 8 for a long time,the screen panel do heats a little.Also,sometimes i have noticed that it gets warm while charging.So in case if it creates a problem for any of you,i mentioned it here. \n#Would update my review as soon as i feel any change in its performance and usage.\n#Give my review a thumbs up if it 's helped you in any manner.

           'text': u"\n I had asked for replacement of the Moto G 3rd gen because of some manufacturing defect. Its been more than 2 weeks that flipkart hasn't updated me about the same though my returned product has been reached more than 2 weeks ago. I have been calling everyday for the update. None of the representative is able to give me any update about the same. Its my first time I'm experiencing such a bad customer care support from Flipkart. The product had boasted about 'WS Retail- Advantage' (irony)! Its so unfortunate and frustrating to see flipkart's service deteriorating like this. Flipkart, if you don't want to give replacement of the product, please give me refund (into bank account and not wallet) of my hard earned money, if you still have any respect for your customer's money and time.

           'text': u"\n Got this phone yesterday. First of all hats off to Flipkart for awesome delivery time. \nNow coming to the phone:\n1. Build Quality: 5/5\n2. 2 GB of RAM with no bolt ware, and awesome RAM management: 5/5\n3. Screen size could have been bigger as we are getting 5.5 inch screen on Honor 4x: 4/5\n4. Resolution is perfect for the price range and PPI makes it much better. 5/5\n5. Battery life is too good.Even though it is having only 2470 mAH battery, with 30% charge, I downloaded about 30 apps on WIFI, used whatsapp on 4g and little bit of gaming, used torch and over all used phone for 4 hours but when got up in the morning battery was still at 10%: 5/5\n6. Camera quality is good and they gave Slow motion video feature as in Iphone that is more than awesomeeeeee: 5/5\n7. Headphones given are of average quality but at least they are giving it other wise Zenphone 2 and Honor 4x don't have headphones. 2/5\n8. Sound quality in music player is good, try with some sony Headphone: 5/5  \nFinally WATER RESISTANCE phone, I already gave it a dip in a bucket of water :D and guess what. It is working..!!!! Just remember to close the back lid as mentioned in the sticker. \nAnd in the end I would says, haters will keep hating it and give bad review. Don't listen to them. \nAbove review is after using for 10 hours. \nAdding Some more points after using for about more than 24 hours\n+No Lags, can handle and switch between upto 12 apps without issues\n+No heating Issue\n+Battery Life is awesome (after a full charge and using for 5 hours with browsing on Wifi, downloading apps and few clicks with cam and 3 slow motion video and whatsapp, battery is still at 80%)\n+Loved the on screen notification \nSo will recommend you to go for it. No need to give a second thought. ",

           'text': u'\n I was initially unsure about which phone to choose between the Mi 4i and the Moto G, but then I got the opportunity to use both so here\'s a review based on the comparison. My review is based on average usage pattern of a couple of calls, a lot of texts, Hike/WhatsApp/FB messages, some browsing, a little (not very graphic intensive) gaming, watching videos on YouTube and on the phone, single SIM usage, and 60-70% time on Wi-Fi. These are my conclusions: \n1. Performances: Day to day performance is fast, zippy and completely lag-free on both. I found the Moto to be slightly snappier (with 18 apps running!) when compared to the Mi 4i (with 6 apps running), but the difference might be too minor to notice in day-to-day performances for most users. \n2. Heating Issues: The Moto heats up a little when charging, but apart from that it is completely free from heating of any kind. Unlike other reviewers, I\'ll have to laud Xiaomi\'s efforts with the Mi 4i though: the new upgrades have reduced the heating levels to a bare minimum, and now it only warms up a little with heavy use. \n3. Battery: The battery on the Moto G can last easily over a day, but it would be wrong to expect more of the 2470mAh battery. However, with the same usage pattern, the Mi 4i\'s battery easily lasts 2 days for me.\n4. Display: The screen is where it really lags: pixels are very much visible and you\'ll be rather disappointed if you\'re viewing it from a 6-10in distance. There\'s also a yellow-ish tint. In comparison, the Mi 4i\'s screen is way nicer. However, brightness, sunlight legibility and viewing angles are exceptionally good on both devices.\n5. Camera: The camera on the Moto G is disappointing if you think it\'s a 13MP/5MP shooter, esp. if you\'re coming from the Mi 4i\'s superior performance. It\'s fast and has a minimal interface, while the the Mi 4i provides far more options in terms of filters, etc. Video quality on the Moto is better than on the Xiaomi in my experience. \n6. Storage: Device storage is where the Moto G beats the Mi 4i hands down. I had no problem storing and accessing my entire season of FRIENDS on the Moto, something I wouldn\'t dream of on the Mi 4i. You get 5GB on the Mi Cloud on the Xiaomi, while you get Google backup on the Moto so cloud storage probably isn\'t something you need to worry about. Both devices have USB-OTG though, and it works just fine on both. \n7. User interface: \n- Vanilla Android on the Moto with it\'s superior bloat-free feel is amazing, particularly after TouchWiz! Though both devices have the same amount of RAM, the Mi 4i\'s bloatware eats into the RAM and leaves only about 900MB RAM with NO active applications. This might explain why the Moto feels smoother despite the lower core-config. \n- I personally prefer the comfort of an app drawer as well as folders: something which only the Moto G offers. Even Nova Launcher keeps crashing on the Mi 4i, which is a negative for someone who might want to customize the UI. Both the Lenovo K3 Note and the Mi 4i lack the app drawer I\'ve come to love, offering only folders and buttons in an Apple-esque fashion. However, others prefer the latter kind so it\'s really upto you. \n- If you care about the quick-access buttons on the notification tray, the Moto G might be a bit of a shocker for you. For instance, there\'s no "Silent" button or dedicated "Mobile Internet" button. Switching on/off the mobile data is a two-step process which should have been a one-step process, and that\'s kinda annoying for me. The Xiaomi\'s configuration in this department - only in this, mind you - like most phones, is pretty standard: hence it\'s probably a little easier to use. \n9. Assisting features: Moto additions to stock Android are actually useful, such as the active display. However, the mi 4i offers notification lights even if not the active display. Overall, I find the active display on the Moto to be more useful than the light - but then, if you\'re used to the notification lights, you might be missing that on the Moto. \n10. Telephony: Both phones offer superior calling facilities and there\'s no call drop. The active noise cancellation works really well on both devices. \n11. Build Quality: Both phones have solid build quality, but the Moto G feels much nicer and sturdier in my hand than the Mi 4i. Moto\'s heavier and bigger, which means I\'m afraid of dropping it half the time. I\'m guessing guys won\'t have this problem, but for us girls, the Mi 4i is definitely much easier to hold. The Gorilla glass IPx7 rating, however, makes me feel safer using the Moto. The Mi 4i has survived 2 drops in as many months so far, though.\n12. Speakers: Despite the single speaker on the Moto, it\'s extremely loud and clear in terms of the sound quality! Listening to music is a pleasure, particularly vocals. The Mi 4i is slightly less loud in my experience, and the speakers (located on the back) tend to get muffled if you keep it on a desk or pillow: but this might be subjective. ',

           'text': u'\n Hello everyone,\nFirst of all I would like to say that I don\'t normally waste my time writing a review, in fact this is technically not a review but my honest opinion about the phone. I am going to refrain from praising flipkart (Oops!) in this, and I will simply write down my thoughts on the parameters which matter to me as follows (Pros or Cons you decide!):\n1. The phone is a 5", which is a perfect fit for my pocket (Always hated my HTC 826 for its size among other things.)\n2. The phone has a hardy and rugged look and I feel it is a good companion for my daily use. Gorilla glass and water proof coating is the icing on the cake.\n3. I listen to a lot of music and read books/news and browse on my phone and often find my phone running out of juice easily. This phone despite having a 2470mAh battery, lasted my torments quite long and still it is at 55%. Now that\'s one adamant little thing.\n4. I don\'t really miss the lack of notification LED, in fact it\'s better this way. I always found that flashing light annoying.Moto display is good enough for me.\n5. Lack of bloatware and forced installed factory apps unlike Asus Zenfone, HTC (dammit ZOE!) makes it even more sexier. The phone\'s UI feels smooth and fast due to stock Android.\n6. Last but not the least, I need at least one 4G connection for my data usage. The other one for calling. The purpose is served, so I am happy.\nSo those are my views based on my requirement. Hope someone will find it useful in making an informed decision.\nRegards\nPritam ',

           'text': u"\n hi frnds , firstly filpkart's in a day service is awesome. \nnow come to the review \nNo doubt this is the best phone in its range and also upto 15k, let me prove u why  \n1. all the phones till 15-17k. u will find that they may have Snapdragon's 410 , but they all are 1.2MHz and MOTO G3 has 1.4GHz \n2. doesn't matter that other phones also have 2gb ram , the question is that , Is the UI of the phone so light that the phone can run smoothly with 2gb ram? \nand the answer is in front of u MOTO G3 has stock android which is so light \n3. if u are in the mood to buy a good phone u probably comparing b/w Lenovo A6000 plus , lenovo K3 note , redmi note 4g , MI4I , samsung j5 , samsung j7 and MOTO G3 . \nnow all these phones have their own UI that means U CAN'T FEEL THE EXPERIENCE OF ORIGINAL ANDROID \nnext ,  \nlenovo and Mi having a big problem that they are getting hang as because their UI is heavy , which shows effects on ram ,that A LARGE AMOUNT OF RAM IS GETTING USED ON THESE PHONES  \nand now talk about samsung J5&J7 these are rejected by me because of the name samsung with them as samsung phones will shows their realities after 6 months i hope u are agree with me ,  \nnow that's why I had chosen MOTO  \nnow for those who are having complaints about moto g3 \n1. Camera:- for those who are having issues with camera , actually the camera is good but it just need a software update of camera application , no issues in the h/w \n2. display:- i know that motorola should give a 1080 display but they made an intelligent decision by increasing battery capacity , \nif they put full hd display in this phone and same battery then everyone will complaint about battery drainage . \nso i think display is right at its place. \nfinally , I don't find any cons in this phone specifically the looks and feel , when u take this phone in your hand it proves its durability and the look which is so stylish .\nnot like the lenovo ,mi and other rectangle bars . \ni made a right decision by choosing this among all , now its your turn my frnd  ",

            'text': u"\n Hi all !! Greetings for the day... \nI had to get a phone within budget of 10k- 15k. First was confused between many options like Lenovo k3 note, Samsung J7, MI, etc. Then this phone was launched, was so impressed by its features and specifications that I ordered for it, taking a chance. Got my MOTO G 3rd GEN phone on time and it was a good delivery by FLIPKART as usual ... After extensively using the phone Iam giving my reviews in order to help other guys thnking of purchasing this phone.  \nDisplay : 4.5/5 (Cool display and is equally good to veiw it from extreme angles)\nCamera : 4.5/5 (Super awsm camera for this price range, and quick capture feature is also awsm. Selfies in low light also came out pretty well and good.)\nCall quality : 5/5 (Clear, crisp and good call quality)\nBuild Quality : 5/5 (Amazing build quality, fits in ur hand and light weight as compared to other mobiles in this range)\nUI: 5/5 (feathery smooth)\nBattery Life: 4.5/5 (After fully charging the battery, used the phone to extreme extent but still it had some power left till the end of the day. Thus it would last for a day fairly, if fully charged) \nWater proof: (Yes it is water proof, tested by placing it in water for some time, stil aftr taking it out, working fantasticly)\nScreen : Thanks to gorilla glass, kept my phone in pocket with othr stuf, evn dropped it into bag full of stuff like keys, charger, compass, etc, but just wipe the screen and it seems as new evrytym. U wont need a flip cover for this. \nCons: Some of the settings are missing, but yet a smooth user interface makes up for all that :)  \nGo ahead folks, don't miss this cute thing..in such a good price..

            'text': u'\n Lets review this and clear your confusion : \n*LENOVO K3 - Batttery drains faster if you wanna make/receive much calls on this device plus it is 5.5inch which is much larger as a pocket friendly. \n*MI4I - As a fact, heating problem is a inbuilt backlog of MI4I Plus Sound Quality is 3rd grade and Pendrive doesnt work properly in this cell.  \n*ASUS ZENFONE 2 - Heating problem, You cannot use internet on 2nd sim slot; its purely a call base sim slot , Network issues, Take very long time to charge , Not recommendable even if you are getting for free of cost  \n*Samsung J5 - If you go buy specifications ; it is having 1.5 GB RAM, 8 GB ROM and 1.2 ghz clock speed which will make difficult for you to do smooth multi-tasking and as its clock speed is only 1.2 ghz it will definetely hang during loading of heavy applications.  \n ** What makes MOTO G3 an unique recommendable phone..????? ** \n(Note - The above mentioned backlogs of the mentioned cellphones are not there in MOTO G3) \n1) Awesome design, sexy HD display with 294 ppi (pixel per index) which makes the cell to look more advance (Design 10/10) \n2) Superb battery life with zero heating issues. (Battery 9/10) \n3) Mindblowing front camera even in low light and awesome rear camera because with Dual smart flash it makes the pic more realistic (Camera 10/10) \n4) Smooth performance even if you use 20 applications at a time or you are playing Large size games as it is builgt with 2 gb RAM (performance 10/10) \n5) Efficiency is good as there is no issue of hanging because its Quad core processor is provided with 1.4ghz clock speed (Efficiency 9/10) \n6) Best phone if you wanna use internet with less battery drain ( 10/10) \n7) Water resistance upto 3 feet and 29.30 minutes having 1px7 rating but Make sure your original back lid (which was attach with the device) is fitted  \n8)Nic phone to watch HD Videos and movies coz it has good viewing angles with smart light (10/10) \n9)Sound output is quite decent with one speaker which is more clear than MOTO G2 having 2 speaker output but if you wanna listen in handsfree mode than purchase some good headsets of Skull candy or Sony as its accessoried handsfree are not impressing (8/10) \n10) It has got 3 great advantages.\na) It will activate Flash light in lock mode if you shake it from left to right fastly\nb) It will activate and change camera mode if you twist it fastly \nc) Its charger got 2 output so you can charge 2 cell phones with one charger with guarenteed safe operation and Its charger output is 1100 mA So your MOTO G3 will complete charge in 2.2 hrs.  \n**** GO For MOTO G (3rd generation) **** \nI had purchased 8 different cell phones in 2 yrs so i have much deep knowledge & can strongly recommend MOTO G3 to buy. #BeSmart #Go4It (y)  \n#innocentmitesh ',

            'text': u"\n This is my first mobile of Moto (I own an HTC 516 and my brother has a Moto E, and he has faced no problem with that till now. *Touchwood*). My first experience was good. The initial set up took some time but the function was smooth and not sluggish. Obviously I bought this for the features and my first check was the camera. Both the front and rear camera quality is great. I took a few snaps with the front camera with dimmed lighting and it came out nice. Overall think the phone stands up to whatever is said about it. \nDon't wanna repeat the specs and give a boring comment on that. But think in this price range Moto has really given a good phone with good features.  \nAnd it seems all what I said is bouncing back on me and hitting me hard. \nThe video playback is sluggish and when I contacted the Moto help thru their online facility, the person said that it will be recurring and I need to follow a list of steps to clear cache on the phone. Now if the problem is recurring, they why can't they service the mobile? Or give a replacement? \nVisited the Moto Service center. They said software needs to be updated. Put up my case to Flipkart and they have taken my mobile back and given a refund.  \nThank you Flipkart.  \nWaiting to book another mobile but it seems to be out of stock at the moment (as on 14/9/15). \nP.S: This is my first review and it may seem blunt but I am not a techie guy and so I have said what I felt at heart.

As always great service from Flipkart. \nNow to the phone, it has better processor, better RAM 2 GB , pure Android, 13 MP very fast rear camera and water resistant features etc etc all this was known from specifications. \nI am writing about experience - first the looks - excellent impressive look, specially back. Feels light and just perfect size in holding. Screen is sharp although not full HD but does the job perfectly. \nSo far the phone is smooth as butter and no lag or hanging. Pure Android is always great. And 2GB RAM seems to be good choice in choosing between the two versions. \nCamera is super fast so far, and the twisting gesture to open camera and same feature to switch between front and back camera is very useful. Picture qualit is superb. Must be best in sub 20k phones.\nOther such smart features are chop chop to start torch, smart lock , trusted places, devices etc. \nOne of the best features is moto display for smart, battery saving notifications. Very useful indeed.\n4G is working just fine so far. Battery in half day continuous use has gone down 50%, too early comment about how will it fare after few months and regular use. \nCall quality is superb and audio quality seems to be improved over last version. Inbuilt audio effects is great addition.\nI have not tested water resistance but its certified so I hope it works.\nSo far so good, infect very good. \nOverall I would say in 13k its best phone as of today, dont go by just specifications comparison, one may find same specs in sub 10k too. But experience is worth it with moto brand. .I am satisfied, worth the wait of last 2 months.   ',

I expected a much new look.   \nDisplay: It has HD display 720 x 1280 pixels (~294 ppi pixel density) with gorilla glass 3 and the touch response is good. The viewing angles are excellent which makes better to watch movies and videos. The brightness is better compared to Moto G2. Over all the display is good.   \nCamera: It has a 13 MP primary camera and 5 MP front camera. The primary camera has much better options than the predecessor and a better clarity. The front camera is not up to the mark.   \nCPU: Have already loaded 20 application and the phone runs as smooth as butter. I did not conduct any tests on this yet but the way I played FIFA 15 on this phone was just awesome, though the phone was got hot after few minutes which is common in all the phones.   \nBattery: As I am posting this review much early so did not get to test the battery. I used it for an hour with playing games on it the battery got drained from 42% to 34%.   \nMemory: It has 16GB internal memory and 11.92GB is available for use. It has 2GB RAM and 1GB is free after loading many apps.   \nOverall the phone is just awesome and the best part is it comes with water resistance and 4G LTE with free 4G airtel sim.

            'text': u'\n Moto G3 is a very good mobile in its price range. Absolutely no issues in that. Though, the screen boasts of Gorilla Glass, it is very sensitive and easily breaks if it falls from a height of just 1-2 feet. My phone accidentally slipped, and the glass broke. Replacement cost is MORE than Rs. 6000. Other options of going for duplicate screen replacement at local shops is not available for this MOTO G. It is hard to find Moto G service centres near by, and even if you find one, they will keep the mobile with them for very very long time, and you would just have to ask them again and again, which could be a frustrating experience. \nSo, BUY A BACK CASE!!

Screen has Lots of horizontal and vertical line, we can see when its tilted to some angle when display is off. When asked customer care folks they said its Gorilla glass and its common, its not a problem.(CHecked with new Moto G3 Phone no lines at all).\n2. Caller is not able to hear voice properly\n3. Mobile gets heated up to 50 degrees when switched Mobile data \nBut Moto customer care said, take it to nearest service centre. We don\'t have that much time to visit service centre.(I did mistake by not asking replacement.) \nAfter 40 days of use its went to switched of and was never able to switch it on again. I went to service center(B2X Koramangala) and given my phone. They said If it has software issue they will give within 2 days and if it has hardware issue then they will replace the part and said it may take 10 days.\nIts been 36 days still i didn\'t get my phone. Service center contact number they have given its always Busy. I followed up with Moto Customer care, every time they kept on telling " you will receive updates within 48 hours ". Till now i didnt get any response from service center nor from Moto Customer Care.\nReally frustrated with Moto Service and Phone. So I don\'t recommend this phone to my friends.

Flipkart You Rocks ".\nNow, \nIf you are planning for this Masterpiece, please wait, Read this review carefully, then decide.\nThis is my 3rd motorola smartphone after moto G and moto E(2nd Gen). I am writing this review after using this mobile for almost one week. As you can see many reviewers has given good rating and very good comments on this mobile. I am also completely agree with them. The build quality, camera, performance, battery backup and others features are really great under 13K. \nNow a simple question to all the owner of this mobile before i comments on the problem. \nFriends, are you able to notice any disturbance with display screen(not with gorilla glass). If not then check once and give your valuable comments. \nLet me tell you in details. Guys there is a problem with the display. There are thick lines through out the screen from top to bottom. You can easily notice this by turning off the display, keep you mobile under light and observe from different viewing angles. If i am not wrong, you will feel like there is a curtain hanging over the display.  \nSo initially i thought there is a problem with this particular piece, so i placed a return request and i got a new piece today. While i was receiving the second one from ekart store, there were another 4-5 people who were unboxing their brand new Moto G3. Then i checked with them, and sadly we all noticed the same problem with all the handsets in presence of eKart guys. Today again i have logged a complain with flipkart customer care and waiting for tomorrow to have a discussion with their technical people. \nI am a big fan of Motorola because of its build quality, i have already used Moto G, Moto E (2nd Gen), but this time it disappointed me. So friends, if this problem is not disturbing for you then definitely go for Moto G3 \nHope this review will help you to evaluate this product. Thank You. ',

            'text': u"\n Moto G (3rd Gen) truly justifies the tagline which was the main highlight of the revolutionary product, the Moto G 1st Gen. The upgrades from the 1st gen may not seem to be worthy upgrades to some customers but what remains on paper, will remain on paper. You can't judge a book by its cover, right. What matters is the experience and Moto G truly lives up to the expectations of those who want a good device at a reasonable price. I am saying reasonable because of the performance, the specs and the build quality.\nComing to the phone, the best thing about it is the display which is very bright and vivid. People will complain about low PPI but they are unaware of the fact that the human eye's maximum recognizable resolution is 300 PPI. Apple isn't fool to stick to 321 PPI. The camera is good, especially the front camera. Speaker performance is decent but the sound output is amazing on a pair of good earphones, I tried it on Sony earphones. Everybody knows about stock android experience. It works seamlessly without any hiccups, thanks to the RAM management and the hardware :D \nThe design of the phone may not be award winning but is very subtle and the phone feels to be very sturdy and because of the metallic finish, the patterned back cover and the strip behind, it doesn't look and feel like a 13k phone. Call quality is pretty good. I couldn't test the battery but it will hopefully last for 1-1.5 days considering the software package that comes along with the phone (no bloatware) which is accompanied by the efficient hardware. The in-box accessories now include a detachable USB cable (finally :P) and one can charge two phones simultaneously since the charger has two USB ports.....smart design :D\nThe icing on the cake is that the phone is now IP certified. Phone got dirty,something got spilled on it! Don't worry, just go and dip it in water and use it, like a boss :P It supports Moto maker too :D but I believe the customization will be slightly on the higher side of the price point \nComing to the cons I couldn't find any in the phone. But Motorala should provide good in-box accessories, like the earphones which are just above average :( Other than this, Motorola Moto G leaves no stone unturned in any department you consider it, whether it is performance, build quality etc :D ",

            'text': u"\n Flipkart is doing amazing job by providing its customers the best handsets in the market. In the league of smartphones, where every other day a new company comes up with new features and attractive prices, I must tell you Moto series from Motorola has made its own league, which is way different from the other handset manufacturers. Moto G is not only a brand, but has also successfully created a trust factor which somewhere was missing in the rush of overflowing smartphones in the market. \nI was initially using Moto G 1st generation, which ofcourse was a big hit from Motorola launched last year. I was completely satisfied with Moto G 1st Gen last year, which I used without a single problem till date. Now I felt the need to upgrade myself to a higher RAM and better camera. Truly speaking, Moto G 2nd Gen never impressed me, and that's the reason I decided to wait a little more. Guys, trust me on this, my wait was worth it. Moto G 3rd Gen is a superb power pack smartphone with an all round performance in each segment. Moreover, the price in which it comes is an added advantage which is just Rs. 12,999/- Two things which I didn't like are firstly they have removed the Pulse LED notification light and secondly the wire of the USB cable is too short. I miss the notification pulse light, as it was in my previous Moto G 1st Gen.  \nSpecifications and technical details I wont discuss here in my review, as its already mentioned everywhere. I liked the screen, the touch, the glaze and the finish of the handset, smoothly designed edges, the compactness and the standard feeling when you hold the device in your hand. The back cover makes the phone grip handy, comfortable and easy to use. Camera is just too good, front as well as the main. Battery seems to be working well in 3G connection. The user interface is so awesome, android Lollypop is fast and efficient. Altogether, the handset works like a wonder. My personal suggestion to all the new buyers, if you have a budget somewhere around 10k-18k, then don't hesitate to buy Moto G 3rd Gen. I am dead sure, you all will thank me later for this advice. Last but not the least, thumbs up for the Flipkart delivery, as I ordered my Moto G3 on its launch day and I received it within 2 days. ",

            'text': u"\n In about a week usage, I found that the phone is heating up, especially in or around camera & the below back panel, within 15-20 minutes of data usage or calls. The smart check app as authorized by Flipkart only checks the CPU internals, which any ways is zero during the call! I think, considering quite a few heating complaints of this device, Flipkart should probe it a bit further rather putting a faith in a app. which well. doesn't have even the authentication certificate to install itself without an warning pop-up.
